- Add messaging on all routes frontend
- Remove User from Trip. Need to add a controller/route on backend. Service and reducer on front end.

- ~~Find a way to return a deep copy of object after filetering for remove_friend because when it runs on the frontend after dispatching removeFriend it only returns the shallow copy. This is because on the backend for the remove_friend controller it uses array.filter and it only returns the shallow copy of the friend array.~~
- ~~Change add member for trip controller to accept array of members~~
- ~~Add delete button to trip page to delete~~
- ~~Populate trip page with trip info~~
- ~~Edit trip info~~
- ~~If friend already is member don't include them in friend array~~
- Create Events
  - Navigate from trip page to create events page and pass trip id and payee (signed in user) to create event page
  - Create Event
  - Add Members to Event and set split cost
  - Create event cards to go on the Trip's detail page
